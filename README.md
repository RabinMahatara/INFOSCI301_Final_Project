# **Visualizing the Relationship Between Atmospheric CO₂ Levels and Extreme Weather Events**

## **Overview**
This project investigates the relationship between rising atmospheric CO₂ levels and the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. By leveraging global datasets and interactive visualizations, we aim to uncover patterns and trends that inform policymakers, researchers, and the public about the impacts of climate change. The repository contains all necessary files for reproducing the visualizations, accessing interactive applications, and understanding the research process.

## **Repository Structure**
The repository is organized as follows:
- **`Code/`**: Contains Python scripts and a Google Colab notebook for generating visualizations.
  - `interactive_visualization.ipynb`: A Google Colab file for running the code directly.
- **`Data/`**: Includes ready-to-use datasets from NASA, NOAA, and EM-DAT (no preprocessing required).
- **`Visualizations/`**: Contains static visualizations generated during the project.
- **`Docs/`**: Includes the detailed project report in PDF format.
  - `INFOSCI301_Final_Project_Report.pdf`
- **`Interactive Apps/`**: Contains an `App.md` file with links to hosted interactive visualizations.
  - `App.md`: Provides URLs to access the interactive apps hosted on GitHub Pages.
- **`Demo Video/`**: Includes a demonstration video showcasing the interactive visualization.
  - `Demo Video.mp4`
- **`Poster/`**: Contains the final project poster summarizing key insights.

## **Key Features**
1. **Data Integration**:
   - Combines datasets from NASA, NOAA, and EM-DAT to analyze CO₂ levels and extreme weather events globally.
   - No preprocessing required; datasets are ready to use.

2. **Interactive Visualization**:
   - A web-based interactive app hosted on GitHub Pages allows users to explore CO₂ trends and extreme weather data dynamically.

3. **Accessible Tools**:
   - All code is provided in a Google Colab notebook, making it easy to run without setting up a local environment.

---

## **Datasets**
The following datasets were used:
1. **NASA EOSDIS**: Satellite-based data on atmospheric CO₂ levels.
2. **NOAA NCEI**: Data on extreme weather events such as floods and droughts.
3. **EM-DAT**: Global disaster database providing information on disaster occurrences and impacts.

---

## **Interactive Visualizations**
The interactive app is hosted on GitHub Pages and allows users to:
- Explore temporal trends in CO₂ levels alongside extreme weather events.
- View regional distributions of droughts and floods using choropleth maps.
- Analyze correlations between CO₂ levels and weather patterns dynamically.

## **Getting Started**

### Running the Code
1. Access the Google Colab notebook in the `Code/` folder: [`INFOSCI301_Final_Project.ipynb`](./Code/INFOSCI301_Final_Project.ipynb).
2. Open the file in Google Colab.
3. Run all cells to generate visualizations or explore data interactively.

### No Environment Setup Required
The interactive app is hosted online via GitHub Pages, so no additional setup is needed to access it.
